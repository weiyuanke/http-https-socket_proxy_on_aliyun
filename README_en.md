## üîç How It Works

This tool uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated deployment to quickly set up proxy and VPN services:

1. Automatically creates a pay-as-you-go ECS instance on Alibaba Cloud using Terraform
2. Configures security group rules to open necessary ports
3. Forwards the remote server's SOCKS proxy to local port via SSH tunnel
4. Automatically deploys VPN services on the remote server on demand (if enabled)
5. Starts SOCKS to HTTP proxy conversion service locally to support more applications
6. Automatically configures system proxy settings, applications require no additional configuration

## üìã System Requirements

### Client Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS or Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- **Software Dependencies**: Will be automatically installed via installation script
- **Account Requirements**: Alibaba Cloud account with valid Access Key credentials

### Alibaba Cloud Requirements
- Sufficient account balance to create pay-as-you-go ECS instances
- Permissions to create ECS, VPC, security groups, and other resources

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Alibaba Cloud Credentials

First, set Alibaba Cloud access credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key-id"
export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
```

> üí° **Tip**: You can add these environment variables to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` files for permanent storage.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the installation script to automatically configure required dependencies:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script will automatically install based on your operating system:
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code tool)
- sshpass (SSH automatic password login tool)
- Necessary system tools
- Homebrew (macOS only, if not installed)

Supports multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora.

### 3. Start Service

#### Deploy Complete Service (Proxy + VPN)
```bash
./start_proxy.sh
```

#### Deploy Proxy Service Only
```bash
./start_proxy.sh --no-vpn  # or use shorthand -n
```

#### Set Service Runtime (default 3600 seconds)
```bash
./start_proxy.sh --timeout 1800  # or use shorthand -t 1800
```

### 4. View Connection Information

After successful startup, you will see detailed proxy and VPN configuration information:

```
‚úÖ Proxy service started
Public IP: x.x.x.x

üîå Proxy Configuration:
- SOCKS5 Proxy: socks5h://127.0.0.1:9002
- HTTP/HTTPS Proxy: http://127.0.0.1:8080

üîí VPN Configuration (if enabled):
- Server Address: x.x.x.x
- Username: vpn
- Password: Admin123
- IPsec PSK: Admin123
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

After the service starts, the system will automatically configure proxy settings. The following is a detailed usage guide:

### Proxy Service Usage

#### Automatic Configuration
The script will automatically configure system proxy settings, and most applications will automatically use these settings.

#### Manual Setup
If you need to manually set up proxy for specific applications, you can use the following environment variables:

```bash
# SOCKS5 Proxy
export HTTP_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:9002
export HTTPS_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:9002

# HTTP Proxy (via conversion tool)
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Proxy Service Addresses
- **SOCKS5 Proxy**: `127.0.0.1:9002`
- **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**: `127.0.0.1:8080`

### Proxy Conversion Tool

The project includes a built-in SOCKS to HTTP conversion tool:

- Location: `socket_to_http/socks2http`
- Function: Converts SOCKS5 traffic to HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Advantage: Enables applications that don't directly support SOCKS proxy to use proxy services
- Auto Start: Automatically started and managed by `start_proxy.sh` script

### Common Application Configuration Examples

#### Command Line Tools
```bash
# curl using proxy
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9002 https://example.com

# wget using proxy
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com
```

#### Git
```bash
# Configure Git to use proxy
git config --global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
git config --global https.proxy https://127.0.0.1:8080

# Unset Git proxy settings
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

2. Modify the following variables:
   ```bash
   # VPN Pre-Shared Key
   VPN_IPSEC_PSK="your-secure-psk"

   # VPN Username
   VPN_USER="your-vpn-username"

   # VPN Password
   VPN_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
   ```
3. Save the file and restart the service

### Adjust Server Specifications

In `providers.tf`, you can adjust instance configuration to meet different needs:

```hcl
# Adjust instance type filter conditions
data "alicloud_instance_types" "default" {
  # Adjust CPU core count
  cpu_core_count = 2

  # Adjust memory size (GB)
  memory_size = 4

  # Adjust instance type family
  instance_type_family = "ecs.s6"
}
```

### Custom Security Group Rules

To limit port opening range, you can modify security group rules in `providers.tf`:

```hcl
# Custom security group rules
resource "alicloud_security_group_rule" "allow_common_ports" {
  type              = "ingress"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  nic_type          = "intranet"
  policy            = "accept"
  port_range        = "22/22"  # Only open SSH port
  priority          = 1
  security_group_id = alicloud_security_group.default.id
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
}

# Add necessary ports for VPN
resource "alicloud_security_group_rule" "allow_vpn_ports" {
  type              = "ingress"
  ip_protocol       = "udp"
  nic_type          = "intranet"
  policy            = "accept"
  port_range        = "500/500,4500/4500,1701/1701"  # VPN ports
  priority          = 1
  security_group_id = alicloud_security_group.default.id
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
}
```

### Adjust Network Configuration

```hcl
# Adjust public network bandwidth
resource "alicloud_instance" "default" {
  # ... other configurations ...
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 10  # Set to 10Mbps
  # ... other configurations ...
}
```
